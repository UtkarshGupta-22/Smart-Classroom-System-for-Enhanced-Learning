# Smart Classroom System for Enhanced Learning

Smart Classroom Software is an AI-powered classroom management system that enables automated student attendance, mobile phone usage detection, and real-time engagement analysis using computer vision and machine learning.

## Features

- Face recognition-based student attendance using DeepFace
- Real-time mobile phone detection using YOLOv8
- Engagement scoring using eye, mouth, gaze, and posture analysis with MediaPipe
- Streamlit-based frontend dashboard for class scheduling, attendance, and performance management
- Optional machine learning-based engagement classifier (Random Forest)
- Session analytics with data export and visual engagement charts

## Technology Stack

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-classroom-software.git
cd smart-classroom-software

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Ensure you have:

i) A working webcam

ii) YOLOv8 weights (yolov8n.pt) in the models/ directory

iii) Haar Cascade file (usually pre-included in OpenCV installation)

Running the System

Start the Backend API (FastAPI)

uvicorn main:app --reload

Launch the Streamlit Dashboard

streamlit run finalfrontend2.py

Register a New Student (Face Images) 

python register_student.py

Run the Smart Classroom Session 

python workingsmartcclassroom.py

Data Logging

i) Attendance logs are saved as CSV in the root or data/ folder with a timestamp.

ii) Engagement session statistics and behavior logs are saved as .csv, .json, and .xlsx.

iii) Visual engagement charts are saved as PNG images.

Screenshots / Demo Videos

i) Mobile Detection Sample

ii) Dashboard Screenshot

Future Enhancements

i) Live database integration (Firebase or PostgreSQL)

ii) Student-wise performance tracking over time

iii) Enhanced voice and tone-based emotion recognition

iv) Custom face recognition model (age-invariant embeddings)

v) Classroom-wide monitoring with dashboards for teachers and administrators
